	<div class="hg">
	<p>   The leveler consists of frame, 3-point linkage, cutting or scraping blade, and thick curved sheet closed from sides to form a bucket. The scraping blade is made from medium carbon steel or low alloy steel, hardened and tempered to about 42 HRC. The blade is joined to the curved sheet with fasteners and can be replaced after being worn out or becoming dull. The working depth of the implement is controlled by hydraulic system of the tractor.
