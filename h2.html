	<h3><u>HISTORY OF SEED SOWING MACHINE</u></h3>
	<div class="hg">
	<p>The first known European seed drill was attributed to Camillo Torello and patented by the Venetian Senate in 1566. A seed drill was described in detail by Tadeo Cavalina of Bologna in 1602. In England, the seed drill was further refined by Jethro Tull in 1701 in the Agricultural Revolution. </p>
