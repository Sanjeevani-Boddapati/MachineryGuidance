	<div class="hg">
	<p>Pruners are designed to smoothly cut thin pieces of wood, as well as anything softer such as the non-woody stems of perennials. If the wood is thin enough (about half an inch or less) and you know where to make your cut, go ahead and do it. Pruners don't take any special technique.</p></div>
