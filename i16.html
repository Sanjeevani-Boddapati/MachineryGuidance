	<h3 align="center"><u>INFORMATION OF SOWING AND SEEDING MACHINE</u></h3>
	<div class="hg">
	<p>  It is a manually operated equipment suitable for transplanting of mat type rice seedlings in rows in puddled soils. It consists of floats made of marine plywood, seedling tray, tray indexing mechanism and pickers for planting seedlings. When the operator pulls the machine and operates the handle, the picker, six in number, gathers two or three seedlings and place them in the puddled soil. The row-to-row distance can be maintained at 200 mm. It can cover 0.04-0.05 ha/h and labour requirement is 40-50 man-h/ha. It results in 5 to 10% increase in yield. It costs Rs 4,500/- and cost of operation is Rs 1250/ha as compared to Rs. 3750/ha with manual method.

The sowing and seeding machine consists of a seed box, fertilizer box, seed and fertilizer metering mechanisms, seed tubes, furrow openers, seed and fertilizer rate adjusting lever and transport cum power transmitting wheel. The fluted rollers are driven by a shaft which gets power from wheels. Fluted rollers fixed in the seed box, receive the seeds into longitudinal grooves and drop them in the seed tube attached to the furrow opener. By shifting the rollers sideways, the length of the grooves exposed to the seed, can be increased or decreased and hence the amount of seed sown can be varied.
