	<p>   The length of a tractor drawn clod crusher could be up to 3.0 meter. On the periphery of the roller, spikes are arranged in helical manner to reduce the draft. 2. The weight of the clod crusher is about 150 - 200 kg If the clods are dry enough and do not break easily then the weight of the crusher is increased by filling the roller from one side with pebbles or stones. 3. Spiked cold crusher has given minimum draft and maximum reduction in clod size. 4. The draft of the spiked crusher is about 60 kg for animal drawn type.</p>
