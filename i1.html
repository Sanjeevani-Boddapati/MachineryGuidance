	<p>
  A rotary tiller, also known as a rototiller, rotavator, rotary hoe, power tiller, or rotary plough (in US plow), is a motorized cultivator that works the soil by means of rotating tines or blades. Rotary tillers are either self-propelled or drawn as an attachment behind either a two-wheel tractor or four-wheel tractor.
