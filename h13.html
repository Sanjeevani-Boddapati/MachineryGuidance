	<h3 align="center"><u>HISTORY OF HARROW</u></h3>
	<div class="hg">
	<p> In Europe, harrows were used in antiquity and the Middle Ages. The oldest known illustration of a harrow is in Scene 10 of the eleventh-century Bayeux Tapestry. An Arabic reference to harrows is to be found in Abu Bakr Ibn Wahshiyya's Nabatean Agriculture (Kitab al-Filaha al-Nabatiyya), of the 10th century, but claiming knowledge from Babylonian sources.
