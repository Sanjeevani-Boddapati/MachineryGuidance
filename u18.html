	<div class="hg">
	<p> Plough is a large fork-like structure which is pulled up and around through with the help of a cow, bull or a tractor
. Ploughing can increase the air circulation in the soil by turning soil up down and around.
. It also increases the water retention capacity of the soil.
. It helps the farmer with eradicating the field with the weeds or unnecessary plants.
.weeds can be potential competition for the plants in the field. Therefore the plants pose danger to the useful 
 plants by fighting for the food resources. The plough helps in removing the weeds from their very roots</p>
