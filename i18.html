Big gardens are capable of producing big harvests. So have a plan for how you’ll harvest your crops and what you intend to do with all those vegetables, season after season.

Check your soil.
Not all soil has been created equal. Soils that are too sandy, have too much clay, or don’t drain well will not produce as much as soil that has the right texture and makeup. Call your county extension office and ask about using a soil test kit. It can help you determine what type of soil you have so you know how to improve it if necessary.

Water.
Mother Nature may, or may not provide all the water and nourishment your garden needs. So think about how you could supplement her best efforts, just in case.

Weather.
Specifically, know when the projected dates for the first and last frosts of the growing season are. There are a variety of online resources for finding this information for your area.
