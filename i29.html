	<div class="hg">
	<p>   The HV trimmer, like all other products in the range of attachments for the Slopehelper system, is characterized by simplicity of use. The trimmer has a powerful brushless motor, which provides continued, controlled movement of the blades as it trims the branches in vineyards. When connecting to the base platform, setting options of the HV trimmer are displayed on the board computer. The operator can decide on the height and width of rows, a row change mode (every second or next row), and the speed of movement</p>
