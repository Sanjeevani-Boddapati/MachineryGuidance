	<h3 align="center"><u>INFORMATION OF  PLOUGH</u></h3>
	<div class="hg">
	<p> In its simplest form the moldboard plow consists of the share, the broad blade that cuts through the soil; the moldboard, for turning the furrow slice; and the landside, a plate on the opposite side from the moldboard that absorbs the side thrust of the turning action. Horse-drawn moldboard plows, which are no longer commonly used, have a single bottom (share and moldboard), while tractor-drawn plows have from 1 to 14 hydraulically lifted and controlled bottoms staggered in tandem. Listers and middlebusters are double-moldboard plows that leave a furrow by throwing the dirt both ways.</p>
