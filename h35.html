	<div class="hg">
	<p>In 1900 the disk plow became more common. By 1930s the tractor replaced the horse. The tractors worked faster, as they could pull larger plows, more blades, at a faster speed. Unfortunately, the constant turning and breaking up of the soil allowed for soil erosion by the wind and rain.</p>
