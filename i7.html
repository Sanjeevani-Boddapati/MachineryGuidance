	<h3 align="center"><u>INFORMATION OF PRUNERS</u></h3>
	<div class="hg">
	<p> Pruners are designed to smoothly cut thin pieces of wood, as well as anything softer such as the non-woody stems of perennials. If the wood is thin enough (about half an inch or less) and you know where to make your cut, go ahead and do it. Pruners don’t take any special technique.

If you have more shrubs and perennials than lawn, you’ll be using your pruners more than any other tool, so it’s nice to take a few moments to think about the steps you go through and consider a few tips to make the job easy on your body and wholesome for your plant.
