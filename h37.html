	<h3 align="center"><u>HISTORY OF DISC HARROW </u></h3>
	<div class="hg">
	<p>Before invention of the modern tractor, disc harrows typically consisted of two sections, which were horse-drawn and had no hydraulic power. These harrows were often adjustable so that the discs could be changed from their offset position. Straightening the discs allowed for transport without ripping up the ground; also, they were not as difficult to pull. Overuse of disc harrows in the High Plains of the United States in the early 20th century may have contributed to the "Dust Bowl".</p>
